## Usage

In order to self-host this project, you need a local instance of MongoDB running as well as your own Sentry account. As of right now, you also need to edit the guild configuration in the codebase in order for the bot to work properly in your guild. After you've sufficed these requirements, simply fill out the values in `.env.example` and change it to `.env` and start the bot with `yarn start`.
